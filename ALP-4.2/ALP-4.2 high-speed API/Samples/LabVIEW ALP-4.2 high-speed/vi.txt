This is part of the ALP application programming interface.
This sample application is contributed by 3rd party. It is
provided as-is, without any warranty or support by ViALUX.

Please always consult the ALP-4 high-speed API description
when customizing this program. It contains a detailled
specification of all Alp... functions.

This very straightforward sample VI is intended to show
how to use LabVIEW's built-in Call External Function
node to utilize the ALP-4.2 high-speed DLL.
Its function is to display a flashing square in the
middle of the DMD area or the PNG File ALP42_XGA.png).
This VI requires LabVIEW 8.0 or higher.

It supports 1080p (emulation) and XGA DMD formats.


Important hint for using this .VI:
==================================

The DLL file alpV42.dll is required. Please make sure
that its platform (32 or 64 bit) matches the LabVIEW
environment.

Do always use the "STOP" labelled button to terminate
the VI and the display of flashing square!
Hitting LabVIEW's "STOP" button (on the tool bar)
will not terminate the ALP-API DLL usage,
and re-starting this VI again will always fail.
If so, you must close and re-open this VI.


Hint for using the ALPV42.DLL in your own .VIs:
===============================================

The .VI programmer must declare the function prototype
as exactly as possible to the C prototype,
and returnable values (C++: memory references,
Delphi: VAR parameters) must be fed by any dummy value.
Otherwise, LabVIEW will crash silently.

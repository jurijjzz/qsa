This is part of the ALP basic application programming interface.
This sample application is contributed by 3rd party. It is
provided as-is, without any warranty or support by ViALUX.

Please always consult the ALP basic API description
when customizing this program. It contains a detailled
specification of all Alpb... functions.

This very straightforward sample VI is intended to show
how to use LabVIEW's built-in Call External Function
node to utilize the ALP-4.2 basic DLL.
Its function is to display a flashing square in the
middle of the DMD area or the PNG File (ALP XGA.png or
ALP 1080p.png) picture.
This VI requires LabVIEW 8.0 or higher.

It supports the XGA and the 1080p (emulation) DMD format.
Modifications are necessary in order to use other DMD formats.


Important hint for using this VI:
=================================

Loading the VI:
The path to the DLL file is stored as absolute file
system path. So it is likely that the DLL file
cannot be found. In this case LabVIEW will query you
for the right path. Please follow the instructions
and point to the DLL file either on
ALP-4.2 Installation CD or to a local copy of the DLL
file.

Please make sure that the ALP basic API DLL platform
(32 or 64 bit) matches the LabVIEW environment.

Stopping the VI:
Do always use the "STOP" labelled button to terminate
the VI and the projection!
Hitting LabVIEW's "STOP" button (on the tool bar)
will not terminate the ALP-4.2 basic DLL usage,
and re-starting this VI again will always fail.
If so, you must close and re-open this VI.


Hint for using the ALPV42BASIC.DLL in your own VIs:
===================================================

The VI programmer must declare the function prototype
as exactly as possible to the C prototype,
and returnable values (C++: memory references,
Delphi: VAR parameters) must be fed by any dummy value.
Otherwise, LabVIEW will crash silently.
